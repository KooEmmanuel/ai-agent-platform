# Icon Placeholder

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon-32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon-48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel images as placeholders.

The icons should represent the AI Agent Assistant - consider using:
- A robot/agent icon
- A chat bubble with AI symbol
- A brain with chat elements
- Or any combination that represents AI assistance

Recommended design:
- Simple, clean design
- High contrast
- Recognizable at small sizes
- Consistent with your brand colors
